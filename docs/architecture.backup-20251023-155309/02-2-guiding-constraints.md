## 2. Guiding Constraints
- Limited budget: preference for managed-but-affordable services (Supabase, Render, Railway) and open-source tooling.
- No paid product data feeds; rely on compliant web scraping plus user-provided receipts.
- Target geography: Gauteng (Johannesburg + Pretoria) with potential expansion.
- Initial retailer set: Checkers/Sixty60, Pick n Pay, Shoprite, Woolworths, Makro (Food Lover's optional Phase 1.5).
- MVP response time: ≤30 seconds per optimisation request for lists ≤60 items.
- Data freshness: 2–4 hour cadences for core staples, with tighter loops for active promos.
