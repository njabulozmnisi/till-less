## 2. Background & Problem Statement
- South African grocery shoppers face high price volatility, opaque promotions, and inconsistent stock information across retailers.
- Manual cross-checking of prices, loyalty deals, and pack sizes is time consuming and error prone.
- Existing tools focus on price comparison without accounting for whole-basket completion, travel effort, or personalized substitution preferences.

TillLess addresses these gaps by normalising retailer data, modelling total cost (price + promotions + loyalty + travel effort + stock risk), and delivering a confident shopping plan for the month.
