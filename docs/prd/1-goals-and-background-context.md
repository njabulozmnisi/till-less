# 1. Goals and Background Context

## 1.1 Goals

- Deliver ≥8% average savings (R240+ per basket) vs. user's baseline single-store shopping
- Reduce grocery shopping decision time to ≤10 minutes through category-first UI
- Achieve ≥85% product matching and categorization accuracy with user confirmation for low-confidence matches
- Enable category-level budget visibility and spend control for SA households
- Support surgical optimization (hybrid baskets splitting categories across retailers when savings justify it) in Phase 1.5
- Build adaptive category portfolios over 3+ months that reduce cognitive load by 60-70% (Phase 1.5)
- Achieve ≥60% category-first UI engagement (users find category view sufficient without drilling down)
- Reach 500 active users within 3 months post-launch (Gauteng-focused MVP)
- Demonstrate loyalty pricing integration as key differentiator vs. competitors (Troli, PriceCheck)
- Validate threshold nudges (R30+ savings, ≤10 min travel) with ≥35% acceptance rate

## 1.2 Background Context

South African grocery shoppers face a dual challenge: significant price variations across retailers (15-40% on identical items) combined with cognitive overload from managing 40+ individual item decisions per shopping trip. Existing solutions (PriceCheck, Troli, Sixty60) offer item-level price comparison or single-retailer convenience but lack category-level budget intelligence and surgical multi-retailer optimization.

TillLess addresses this gap through category-aware basket optimization with a 2.5-level hierarchy (5-8 core categories, sub-buckets, strategy tags) that mirrors how users actually budget and shop. The platform integrates loyalty pricing (Xtra Savings, Smart Shopper, WRewards), travel cost modeling, and personalization through optimization personas (Thrifty, Balanced, Premium Fresh, Time Saver). The MVP targets budget-conscious Gauteng families spending R3,000+ monthly on groceries, with foundational category features in Phase 1 and advanced capabilities (category portfolios, surgical optimization, household budgets) in subsequent phases.
