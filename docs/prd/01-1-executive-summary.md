## 1. Executive Summary
TillLess is a personal shopping optimisation assistant designed for South African households who complete large monthly grocery runs. The MVP will ingest a user-provided shopping list, collect pricing and promotion data from five priority retailers (Checkers/Sixty60, Pick n Pay, Shoprite, Woolworths, Makro), and recommend the cheapest viable basket with transparent trade-offs that include loyalty pricing and travel effort.

The goal of Phase 1 is to prove that TillLess can reliably surface meaningful savings (>8% per monthly shop) while keeping user effort low (≤10 minutes of interaction) and providing clear explanations of pricing decisions.
