# 8. Next Steps

## 8.1 UX Expert Prompt

You are the **UX Expert** for TillLess, a category-aware grocery shopping optimization platform for South Africa.

**Your Task:** Review this PRD and create a comprehensive UX/UI design specification covering:

1. **Detailed User Flows:** Map complete journeys for:
   - First-time onboarding (5 screens)
   - Adding items with auto-categorization feedback
   - Running optimization and reviewing nudges
   - Managing loyalty cards and profile

2. **Wireframes & Component Specifications:** Using Shadcn UI (October 2025) and Tailwind CSS v4:
   - Category Card component
   - Threshold Nudge alert
   - Optimization Results screen
   - Shopping List Dashboard
   - Persona Selection screen

3. **Responsive Design System:** Define layouts for mobile (320-767px), tablet (768-1279px), desktop (1280px+)

4. **Accessibility Compliance:** WCAG AA standards (color contrast, keyboard nav, screen readers, touch targets ≥44px)

5. **Design Tokens:** Document Tailwind v4 custom theme (OKLCH colors, typography, spacing)

**Deliverables:**
- UX flow diagrams
- Shadcn UI component specifications with code examples
- Responsive layout mockups for 3 core screens
- Accessibility checklist

**Key Constraints:**
- Shadcn UI (October 2025) components exclusively
- Tailwind CSS v4 with OKLCH colors
- Mobile-first design
- Dark mode support (next-themes)

## 8.2 Architect Prompt

You are the **Software Architect** for TillLess, a category-aware grocery shopping optimization platform for South Africa.

**Your Task:** Review this PRD and create a comprehensive technical architecture design covering:

1. **System Architecture:** Design modular monolith with DDD bounded contexts:
   - Shopping, Retailer, Optimization, Crowdsourcing, Auth contexts
   - Aggregate roots, value objects, domain events

2. **Database Schema Design:** Using Prisma:
   - Complete schema for all entities
   - Indexes for performance
   - Relations and foreign keys
   - Category hierarchy optimizations

3. **API Design:** Using tRPC:
   - Router structure
   - Procedure signatures with Zod validation
   - Protected vs. public procedures
   - Error handling

4. **Data Acquisition Framework:** Design pluggable Strategy pattern:
   - IDataAcquisitionStrategy interface
   - Concrete strategies: Web scraping, API, PDF OCR, Manual, Crowdsourced
   - DataAcquisitionService orchestrator

5. **Optimization Algorithm:** Design category-level optimization:
   - Input: ShoppingList, User (persona, location, loyalty)
   - Process: Fetch prices, group by category, calculate costs, apply thresholds, model travel
   - Output: OptimizationResult
   - Caching strategy (Redis, 5-min TTL)
   - Performance target: <2s for 40-item list

6. **Deployment Architecture:**
   - Nx monorepo structure
   - Vercel (Next.js), Railway (NestJS), Supabase (Postgres), Upstash (Redis)
   - CI/CD with GitHub Actions

**Deliverables:**
- Architecture diagram (C4 model: Context, Container, Component)
- Complete Prisma schema with migrations
- tRPC router specifications
- Data acquisition framework class diagram
- Optimization algorithm pseudocode/flowchart
- Deployment diagram

**Key Constraints:**
- Nx monorepo with Nrwl Nx
- Modular monolith with DDD (NestJS modules)
- tRPC for type-safe API
- Prisma + Supabase Postgres
- Target: ~R150/month infrastructure
- Performance: Optimization <2s, API p95 <500ms
