### 3.1 Primary Goals
1. Provide a deterministic cheapest-basket recommendation for a user’s shopping list across the five retailers.
2. Surface item-level savings insights and explain why the winning store combination is optimal.
3. Reduce cognitive load by automating data gathering, product normalisation, and promo calculations.

### 3.2 Success Metrics (MVP)
- **Savings**: ≥8% average total basket savings vs. user’s baseline store.
- **Completion**: ≥95% of items matched to retailer products; ≤5% manual override rate.
- **Effort**: User completes planning workflow in ≤10 minutes.
- **Trust**: ≥80% of recommendations accepted (measured via post-shop feedback).
- **Accuracy**: ≤3% variance between predicted and actual till receipts for monitored baskets.
