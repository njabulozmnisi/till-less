# Story 6.2: Ops Runbooks & Performance Baselines

- **Status:** Draft
- **Epic:** 6 – Ops & Reliability Enhancements
- **Related PRD Sections:** `docs/prd/12-12-risks-mitigations.md`
- **Related Architecture Sections:** `docs/architecture/04-4-component-breakdown.md`, `docs/architecture/09-9-monitoring-alerting.md`

## Story Statement
Establish operational runbooks and performance baselines so the team can respond to incidents quickly and ensure the MVP meets SLA targets.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Runbooks created/updated for optimisation API incidents, BetterAuth outages, and Supabase failures (documents in `docs/ops/`).
- [ ] Load testing performed for optimisation API (60-item lists) demonstrating P95 < 30s; results documented.
- [ ] Synthetic monitoring (GitHub cron or Grafana Synthetic) hits optimisation endpoint hourly with alert thresholds.
- [ ] On-call rotation documented with escalation matrix and contact info.
- [ ] Post-incident report template prepared.

## Tasks & Subtasks
1. **Runbook Authoring**
   - Draft docs covering detection, triage, rollback for API/auth/database.
2. **Performance Testing**
   - Use k6 or Artillery to simulate workloads; record metrics.
3. **Synthetic Checks**
   - Configure cron job hitting health endpoints and logging latency.
4. **On-call Process**
   - Define schedule, create Slack channel, document escalation.
5. **Templates & Training**
   - Add post-incident template; schedule walkthrough session.

## Dependencies
- Core services deployed to staging/production.

## QA Checklist
- [ ] Runbooks/viz links attached.
- [ ] Load test report and synthetic monitoring evidence.
