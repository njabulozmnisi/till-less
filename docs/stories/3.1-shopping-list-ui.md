# Story 3.1: Shopping List Input & Import UI

- **Status:** Draft
- **Epic:** 3 – Shopping List Experience (Frontend)
- **Related PRD Sections:** `docs/prd/05-5-scope-phase-1-mvp.md`, `docs/prd/07-7-detailed-requirements.md`
- **Related Architecture Sections:** `docs/architecture/04-4-component-breakdown.md`

## Story Statement
Deliver the initial Next.js interface allowing users to create, edit, and import shopping lists with quantity, unit, and substitution preferences.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Responsive list builder UI with add/edit/remove item interactions and validation (required fields, unit options).
- [ ] CSV import capability using standard template; validation errors surfaced inline.
- [ ] Persist draft list to backend (NestJS API) via authenticated request; support auto-save every 30 seconds.
- [ ] Accessibility baseline (keyboard navigation, aria labels) met.
- [ ] Jest/React Testing Library coverage for core components.

## Tasks & Subtasks
1. **Design Implementation**
   - Build components for item row, unit selector, substitution toggle, must-have checkbox.
2. **CSV Importer**
   - Implement client-side parser (Papaparse) with schema validation; map to list state.
3. **API Integration**
   - Use BetterAuth session to call backend list persistence endpoints; handle loading/error states.
4. **Validation & UX**
   - Provide inline errors, empty-state guidance, and success toast on save.
5. **Testing & Docs**
   - Component/unit tests; update UI README with usage instructions.

## Implementation Notes
- Use Tailwind/Design System components for consistency.
- Keep state in React Query or Zustand to support future sharing features.

## Dependencies
- BetterAuth integration (Epic 4) provides session tokens.
- Backend list endpoints (future Story 4.x) available.

## QA Checklist
- [ ] Video or screenshots of UI interactions.
- [ ] Accessibility audit summary.
